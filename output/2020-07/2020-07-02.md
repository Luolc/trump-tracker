If I didn‚Äôt demand that National Guard Troops go into Minneapolis after watching how poorly the Liberal Democrat government was handling things, you wouldn‚Äôt even have a Minneapolis now. Once they were deployed, in force, all looting, burning and crime stopped DEAD!

The Governor of North Carolina, @RoyCooperNC, made it absolutely IMPOSSIBLE for the Republican Party to have its Convention there - and we all love the State. Millions of Dollars, &amp; JOBS, lost by State. VOTE FOR @DanForestNC!

.@CNN should move Fredo back to the morning slot. He was rewarded for bad ratings with a much better time slot - and again got really bad ratings. Getting totally trounced by @FoxNews. Give him another shot in the morning - He would easily beat Morning Joe‚Äôs poorly rated show!

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a trap because they want to tank the economy and make everything look trrrible so they can make President Trump look bad in November. They want Trump to have to send in troops so it looks bad for him.‚Äù  Dave Rubin, author of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Burn This Book.‚Äù @seanhannity

Mail-In Ballots will lead to massive electoral fraud and a rigged 2020 Election. Look at all of the cases and examples that are out there right now, with the Patterson, N.J., being the most recent example. Republicans, in particular, cannot let this happen!
