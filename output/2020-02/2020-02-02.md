Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie, something they wouldn‚Äôt do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again, 2016.

Mini Mike is part of the Fake News. They are all working together. In fact, Bloomberg isn‚Äôt covering himself (too boring to do), or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! It‚Äôs all the Fake News Media, and that‚Äôs why nobody believes in them any more.
