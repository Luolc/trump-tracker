Great News! Randall Stephenson, the CEO of heavily indebted AT&amp;T, which owns and presides over Fake News @CNN, is leaving, or was forced out. Anyone who lets a garbage ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù do and say the things that CNN does, should leave ASAP. Hopefully replacement will be much better!

Just spoke to President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador. Will be helping them with Ventilators, which are desperately needed. They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border!

Great conversation with President Lenin Moreno of the Republic of Ecuador. We will be sending them desperately needed Ventilators, of which we have recently manufactured many, and helping them in other ways. They are fighting hard against CoronaVirus!

I will never let our Post Office fail. It has been mismanaged for years, especially since the advent of the internet and modern-day technology. The people that work there are great, and we‚Äôre going to keep them happy, healthy, and well!

Our Country wants to move safely forward. There is a tremendous pent up demand. We will open big!
## 13:38:16
Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus. Ventilators, building hospitals, beds and yes, Testing, have been handled incredibly well. Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up!

I (or @VP) never gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines. FAKE NEWS! Spas, beauty salons, tattoo parlors, &amp; barber shops should take a little slower path, but I told the Governor to do what is right for the great people of Georgia (&amp; USA)!
