..Even whether it‚Äôs dumb warmongers like John Bolton, social pretenders like Bob Woodward, who never has anything good to say, or an unstable niece, who was now rightfully shunned, scorned and mocked her entire life, and never even liked by her own very kind &amp; caring grandfather!

If the incompetent Mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, doesn‚Äôt get control of his city and stop the Anarchists, Agitators, Rioters and Looters, causing great danger to innocent people, we will go in and take care of matters the way they should have been taken care of 100 days ago!

The Fake News doesn‚Äôt want to report these numbers. The @latimes and others believed the Crooked Dems before the real numbers came out. Too bad we don‚Äôt have honest reporting when it comes to ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù. Phony sources, they say anything and think they get away with it. November 3rd. https://t.co/gyHx898DXn

Great total numbers for the Republican National Convention. Blows Democrat National Convention away. Also, much bigger fund raising numbers!

Kenosha has been very quiet for the third night in a row or, since the National Guard has shown up. That‚Äôs the way it works, it‚Äôs all very simple. Portland, with a very ungifted mayor, should request help from the Federal Government. If lives are endangered, we‚Äôre going in!

About the only way a person is able to write a book on me is if they agree that it will contain as much bad ‚Äústuff‚Äù as possible, much of which is lies. It‚Äôs like getting a job with CNN or MSDNC and saying that ‚ÄúPresident Trump is great.‚Äù You have ZERO chance. FAKE NEWS!

Wow! Despite the Democrats views across TV and online lie (Con!), we had 147.9 million, the Republican National Convention blew the Democrat National Convention  AWAY. Not even close! Just like their lies on Russia, Football (PLAY!) and everything else! NOVEMBER 3rd.
