Governor @GavinNewsom of California won’t let restaurants, beaches and stores open, but he installs a voting booth system in a highly Democrat area (supposed to be mail in ballots only) because our great candidate, @MikeGarcia2020, is winning by a lot. CA25  Rigged Election!

Why is it that all of the political pundits &amp; consultants that I beat so easily &amp; badly, people that charged their clients far more than their services were worth, have become so totally “unhinged” when it come to your favorite President, me. These people are stone cold crazy!

So in California, the Democrats, who fought like crazy to get all mail in only ballots, and succeeded, have just opened a voting booth in the most Democrat area in the State. They are trying to steal another election. It’s all rigged out there. These votes must not count. SCAM!

Mike has my complete &amp; total endorsement. We need him badly in Washington. A great fighter pilot &amp; hero, &amp; a brilliant Annapolis grad, Mike will never let you down. Mail in ballots, &amp; check that they are counted! https://t.co/KMS62yCyfl
