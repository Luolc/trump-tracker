The Do Nothing Democrats and their leader, the Fake News Lamestream Media, are doing everything possible to hurt and disparage our Country. No matter what we do or say, no matter how big a win, they report that it was a loss, or not good enough. The Enemy of the People!

Well run States should not be bailing out poorly run States, using CoronaVirus as the excuse! The elimination of Sanctuary Cities, Payroll Taxes, and perhaps Capital Gains Taxes, must be put on the table. Also lawsuit indemnification &amp; business deductions for restaurants &amp; ent.

Governors should let roads and highway construction begin before heavy traffic starts, which will be soon. Some Governors never stopped, which proved to be very smart. They built and fixed roads during long no traffic periods. Also, saved big dollars!

Most of the money raised by the RINO losers of the so-called ‚ÄúLincoln Project‚Äù, goes into their own pockets. With what I‚Äôve done on Judges, Taxes, Regulations, Healthcare, the Military, Vets (Choice!) &amp; protecting our great 2A, they should love Trump. Problem is, I BEAT THEM ALL!
