Mini Mike, ‚ÄúThree months ago I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump, (and I failed miserably!).

Elizabeth ‚ÄúPocahontas‚Äù Warren, other than Mini Mike, was the loser of the night. She didn‚Äôt even come close to winning her home state of Massachusetts. Well, now she can just sit back with her husband and have a nice cold beer!

RT @brithume: Good insight here. But there is one unifying factor that will be there in the fall: Donald J. Trump.
## 11:52:25
The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders, AGAIN! Even the fact that Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race was devastating to Bernie and allowed Sleepy Joe to unthinkably win Massachusetts. It was a perfect storm, with many good states remaining for Joe!

So selfish for Elizabeth Warren to stay in the race. She has Zero chance of even coming close to winning, but hurts Bernie badly. So much for their wonderful liberal friendship. Will he ever speak to her again? She cost him Massachusetts (and came in third), he shouldn‚Äôt!

The Mayor of Los Angeles, @ericgarcetti, is dealing with us trying to get the Federal Government to fix the terrible problem he and the Dems have caused with the homeless, and the horrendous effects it is having on the City, which is a mess. I then watch him talk ‚Äútrash‚Äù on me!

The biggest loser tonight, by far, is Mini Mike Bloomberg. His ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike!

The great people of Montana can have no better VOICE than Senator @SteveDaines. He is doing an incredible job! Whoever the Democrat nominee may be, please understand that I will be working hard with Steve all the way, &amp; last night I was 20 for 20 (per @GOPLeader). WE NEED STEVE!
## 20:06:11
Pandering Mini Mike Bloomberg, along with his wacky friend, Tom Steyer, have found out the hard way that you can‚Äôt buy the election! They both wish they had it to do over again!
## 15:21:44
Wow! If Elizabeth Warren wasn‚Äôt in the race, Bernie Sanders would have EASILY won Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas, not to mention various other states. Our modern day Pocahontas won‚Äôt go down in history as a winner, but she may very well go down as the all time great SPOILER!

This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States &amp; then doesn‚Äôt have the wisdom or courage to stare down &amp; end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins! https://t.co/2jGnRgOS6h

Mini Mike Bloomberg just ‚Äúquit‚Äù the race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didn‚Äôt have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe‚Äôs campaign, hoping to save face. It won‚Äôt work!
